  <h3>What's Bitcamp?</h3>
  <div class="padded-content">
    <br />Bitcamp is a place for exploration. We’re a hackathon that values
    participant experience and mentorship over competitiveness and points. Come
    to have fun with your friends, learn something new, eat s’mores, and have a
    generally awesome time. We have all sorts of crazy activities planned for
    you...you’ll have to come to find out the rest! <br /><br />
    <h3>What’s a hackathon?</h3>
    <br />A hackathon is a creative coding marathon. Students are encouraged to
    come with an idea, form teams, and then build out that idea into a product
    in 36 hours. For Bitcamp, we want you to take something you love (sports!
    art! camping!) and combine it with technology to make something awesome. It
    is a great time to push the envelope and learn some new skills. <br /><br />
    <h3>Where’s Bitcamp?</h3>
    <br />Bitcamp 2016 will take place at the
    <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Y6CbkMAwLm72">Reckord Armory</a> on the
    University of Maryland campus. <br /><br />If you are coming from I95/I495:
    Exit at College Park/US-1 (#25), go south on US-1 for about two miles until
    reaching the Visitor Center on your right. Turn right into the parking lot
    and park in lots C1 or C2. <br /><br />If you are coming from Washington
    D.C.: Take Rhode Island Avenue (US-1) north to College Park, which will turn
    into Baltimore Avenue (US-1). Turn left into the parking lot for the
    Visitors Center and park in lots C1 or C2. <br /><br />If you are traveling
    via Metro: Ride the Green Line to the College Park Metro Station, and take
    the University of Maryland

    <h3>Experience + Ideas</h3>
    <br />Don’t be afraid if you don’t think you have enough experience, a team
